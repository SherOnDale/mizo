## Greeting
In the morning, we say **Ohayou gozaimasu**
During the day, we say **Konnichiwa**
In the evening, we say **Konbanwa**
**Sayonara** - That's Goodbye!

## Other new words I learned today

1. Before eating, you always say **Itadakimasu**. It's a bit like say "Let's eat" or "Thanks for the meal".

2. **Takoyaki** - It's diced octopus cooked in batter.

3. **Soba** - It's a noodle dish served cold.

4. **Sashimi** - It's a raw sliced fish.

5. **Kanpai** - That's how you say "cheers!" in Japanese! You'll usually hear it when people are sharing alcohol, but not so much for regular drinks.

6. **Ramume** - A sweet and fizzy drink. It's a bit like lemonade! Ramune come in a glass bottle sealed with a marble. You need to pop the marble out to drink.

7. **Matcha** - A popular style of green tea. It's high in antioxidants and quite good for you. Matcha is brewed and served in elegant tea ceremonies.

8. **Kouhii** - Japanse pronounciation for coffee. Coffee is very popular in Japan and you can even find it in cans! These are sold in shops and vending machines, and can be served cold and hot.

9. **Nan sai desu ka** is "How old are you?". If we break down the sentence, you can translate the meanings. **Nan sai** means "What age", but it isn't specifically a question. To form a question in Japanese, you use **desu ka** at the end of the sentence. And there's no question mark used!

10 **(Age) sai desu** = I'm (age) years old.
